# Phase 4 Report

## Register allocation

- Due to time limit, we choose to implement naive implementation for register allocation.
- For each variable in IR, we store it in the memory with offset according to `var_id` we assign to that variable. Whenever we use the variable, we load it from the correct address in the memory, and store the value in one of registers `t0, t1, t2`
- For immediate value (when a condition IR encountered),  we use register `t3` to store it temporarily.
